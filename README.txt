What's new in Kernel Prolog

Kernel Prolog replaces conventional side effects in Prolog
by introducing first-class engines and FLUENTS - stateful objects
which give a uniform view on external Java objects file streams,
the Prolog database and resolution process.

Still, the the look and feel of basic Prolog and its (Horn Clause) 
syntax are preserved.

Kernel Prolog can be seen as an executable specification
of how a next generation Prolog can look - despite its compact
design it has features going far beyond ISO Prolog.

Enjoy,

Paul Tarau

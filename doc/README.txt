Welcome to Kernel Prolog!

Licensing:

Kernel Prolog has been built as a derivative of Jinni
( http://www.binnetcorp.com/Jinni ) such that future Jinni 
extensions and components are likely to be compatible with it. 

Kernel Prolog is available in Open Source form under 
GNU Public License (GPL) as described at:

http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html

As a convenience to developers of non-GPL commercial applications,
BinNet Corporation, which holds the copyright on the original
Kernel Prolog code, will make it available under a dual commercial 
license, going beyond GPL, to developers prefering to build
proprietery components embedding Kernel Prolog in binary form.

Under this model, changes to Kernel Prolog code become property
of their respective authors and are usable in commercial
binary applications.

Contact BinNet Corp at binnetcorp@binnetcorp.com for requests 
on arranging a customized commercial licensing model.

Key Source Modules

Take a look in Builtins.java and tarau/jinni/lib.pl where most
of the user level facilities are implemented.

What's new in Kernel Prolog

Kernel Prolog replaces conventional side effects in Prolog
by introducing first-class engines and FLUENTS - stateful objects
which give a uniform view on external Java objects file streams,
the Prolog database and resolution process.

Still, the the look and feel of basic Prolog and its (Horn Clause) 
syntax are preserved.

Kernel Prolog can be seen as an executable specification
of how a next generation Prolog can look - despite its compact
design it has features going far beyond ISO Prolog.

Enjoy,
